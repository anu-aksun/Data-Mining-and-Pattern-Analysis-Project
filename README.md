# Data Mining and Pattern Discovery Analysis

This project focuses on applying core **data mining techniques** to analyze structured data, discover hidden patterns, and extract meaningful insights. The notebook demonstrates an end-to-end data mining workflow, starting from data preprocessing to analytical interpretation.

The project is designed to reflect academic and industry-level data mining practices.
